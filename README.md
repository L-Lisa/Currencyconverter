A simple currency converter, see how much your Swedish cash is worth in different countries.

Summary of coming improvements I would add with more time:
Error handling 
Add try catch into the fetch
Make nice error messages
Headers for the api key to separate api key from url
Animation and flag on the info section
Separate layout for desktop and mobile
Make nice component for the list item, with my reusable card
