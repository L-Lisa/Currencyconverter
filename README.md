A simple currency converter, see how much your Swedish cash is worth in different countries.

This was a short project, built with React and styled compontnes.

Summary of coming improvements I would add with more time:
There is mixed content issues here, the Api provider does not have a https verion with my subscription. This needs to be adressed to provide a secure webpage.
Error handling,
Add try catch into the fetch,
Make nice error messages,
Headers for the api key to separate api key from url,
Animation and flag on the info section,
Separate layout for desktop and mobile,
Make nice component for the list item, with my reusable card,
